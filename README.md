# Machine-Learning-Model-13
## **Create an image classification model using a neural network model to classify images of clothing from the Fashion MNIST dataset directly from TensorFlow**

* The dataset is relatively small and used to verify that an algorithm works as expected.
* It has 60,000 images to train the network and 10,000 to evaluate how accurately it learned to classify images.
